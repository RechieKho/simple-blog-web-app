# Simple Blog Web App 
This is my first react application that I had made by following [The Net Ninja's Full React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j942wKiXFu8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d). It is created with create-react-app. 

There is a lot of out-of-date stuff here as I created this web app 7 months ago (Around December 2020). This repository is not intend to help you in your project or your learning but just an "achievement" for me starting learning React.

## Reminder for my future self
I know you probably using webpack right now and abandon create-react-app. 

1. to start up development server, you need two console:
- One for react app itself
```bash
npm run start
```
- Another one is for the json server
```bash
npm run json
```
